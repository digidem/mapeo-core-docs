Mapeo Core is a secure open-source, offline-first, peer-to-peer embedded database for storing geographic data and media (photos, video, audio).

* **Secure**: All data in Mapeo Core is cryptographically signed by the author with a complete edit history, similar to how a blockchain works. The signatures prove the origin of the data. Synchronization between devices is end-to-end encrypted.
* **Open-source**: You are free to modify and re-use the source code.
* **Offline-first**: Mapeo Core is designed to work completely offline and does not require internet or a connection to a server.
* **Peer-to-peer**: There is no central Mapeo Core database: all users who are part of a shared Mapeo project create and edit data locally on their device. When users synchronize data between devices (either offline over direct Wifi connections or over the internet), each device ends up with an exact replica of the same Mapeo Core database.
* **Embedded**: Mapeo Core is embedded in the Mapeo desktop and mobile apps and all data is stored securely locally on the users devices.
* **Media storage**: Mapeo currently stores and synchronizes photos, and in the future will support audio and video files too.
